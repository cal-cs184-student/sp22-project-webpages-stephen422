<h2 align="middle">Notes</h2>
<p>
  I chose part 1 and part 4 for my implementation.
  I used the staff library (<code>BUILD_CUSTOM=Off</code>), not the
  code from my 3-1 submission.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  This assignment was about finishing off the global illumination renderer
  with more focus on materials and lenses, where we modeled BRDFs of
  additional materials like glass, and effects of an nonzero-sized camera lens.
</p>
<p>
  This part really shows the versatility and simplicity of a physically-based
  renderer, where just by slightly adjusting the behavior of the rays, we
  can model highly sophisticated and realistic effects with low effort.
  We did not have to change any part of the rendering pipeline to achieve this.
  It would take significantly larger amount of effort to implement similar
  effects in a rasterization-based renderer, with a much more complicated
  pipeline.
</p>

  Show a sequence of six images of scene CBspheres.dae rendered with
  max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should be
  at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light.

<h4>
  Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
</h4>
<p>
Notable multibounce effects include:
<li>Reflections of the surroundings on the two spheres,</li>
<li>Refractions of the surroundings on the right sphere,</li>
<li>Bright spot on the blue wall, which comes from the refracted
rays from the right sphere,</li>
<li>Bright spot on the bottom of the right sphere, where the refraction from the ceiling light
 bounced off the floor and again at the sphere,</li>
<li>Right sphere's reflected image shown in the left sphere, where its
  reflection is shown at <code>m=4</code>, and
  refraction as well at <code>m>=5</code>.</li>
</p>

<h4>
  Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear.
</h4>
<p>
<li>
  At max depth 1, the spheres look entirely black except the 1-bounce light
  because no reflection rays from the surrounding objects can be modeled.
</li>
<li>
  At max depth 2, we can see the reflection of the surroundings.  We can't
  see the refraction on the right sphere however, because refracted rays
  require 1 additional depth to travel through the material.
</li>
<li>
  At max depth 3, we start to see the refraction as well.  However,
  the reflection of the right sphere inside the left sphere is black, because
  those rays require at least 4 depth:
  <code>light --> surrounding --> right sphere --> left sphere --> eye</code>.
</li>
<li>
  At max depth 4, the reflection of the right sphere is no longer black, showing
  reflected rays on the right sphere.  The refraction on the right sphere is
  not visible yet in the reflected image because refraction needs 1 additional
  depth.
</li>
<li>
  At max depth 4, we can also see a bright spot on the blue wall, because
  that is from the right sphere's refracted rays (visible at <code>m=3</code>)
  that took an additional bounce off the wall.
</li>
<li>
  At max depth 5, now all the reflected/refracted rays on the right sphere
  is visible on its reflected image inside the left sphere.
</li>
<li>
  At max depth 100, render does not look significantly different from depth 5, but
  it is slightly brighter.  This is because the paths with higher depth,
  which have higher radiance sum over the rays along its path, are modeled.
  Interestingly there is a brighter reflection on top of the right sphere: this is
  likely from the bright rays that got reflected from the white ceiling.
</li>
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Depth of Field</h2>
<h4>
  In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and
  a thin-lens camera model.
</h4>
<p>
The pinhole camera model does not take into account the change of direction of a
ray when it goes through the aperture of the camera.  In reality, however small
the aperture is, it is a transparent lens that refracts the ray that goes
through it.  The thin-lens camera model models this refraction, leveraging
the fact that a thin lens always have a fixed focal plane where all of the
objects on the focal plane are focused clearly on the image plane, or the sensor
of the camera. This means that a group of rays that originate from an unfocused
object
no longer intersects the same point on the image plane, which results in
a blurry image for that object.
</p>

<h4>
  Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a
  scene.
</h4>
<p>
Below are the images that have increasing value of the focal distance.  We can
see that different parts of the Lucy statue gets focused on the image, from
closest (torch) to furthest (corner of the Cornell box) from the camera.
Aperture size was 0.1.

<h4>
  Show a sequence of 4 pictures with visibly different aperture sizes, all
  focused at the same point in a scene.
</h4>
<p>
  We can see that as the aperture size gets larger, the objects that are
  not on the focal plane gets more blurrier: the hand, light, right wing of Lucy
  and the corner behind gets blurrier with the larger aperture sizes.
</p>
<p>
  This is expected because a smaller aperture is
  closer to the pinhole camera model that we rendered before, where objects at any
  distance gets focused on the image plane and therefore everything is clear.
