<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project was about techniques to build and manage meshes, the central data
  structure in computer graphics to represent objects realistically. We learned
  about how to represent curves that are easily managable with control points
  without having to enumerate all the points along the curve manually. We also
  learned how to manipulate existing polygon meshes, specifically manifolds, to
  convert them into a higher-resolution one that can have higher fidelity using
  surface subdivision, i.e. without editing the meshes manually.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

  <h4>
    Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order
    to evaluate Bezier curves.
  </h4>
  <p>
    de Casteljau's algorithm outlines the computational steps to evaluate Bezier
    curves. Bezier curve is a polynomially parameterized curve that meets
    specific boundary conditions at each points, e.g. their value and also their
    derivative. While you can find out each of the coefficients of the
    polynomial algebraically using the Hermite matrix form, de
    Casteljau's algorithm provides an easier way by recursively doing linear
    interpolation points along the lines of the control points, where the
    final step gives an actual point that lies on the curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    I implemented the algorithm by writing a single step in this recursive
    linear interpolation process, i.e. <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep()</code>.
    It is a simple function that does the <code>(t, (1-t))</code>
    linear interpolation between all adjacent <code>size()-1</code> point pairs
    stored in the <code>points</code> parameter.
    The skeleton code would then repeatedly call this function until it reaches
    the final point.
  </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

  <h4>
    Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and
    how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
  </h4>
  <p>
    Extension of de Casteljau algorithm to 2D surfaces is basically carrying out
    the algorithm in one direction, and applying it hierarchically to the other
    direction.  For n x n points, we carry out the algorithm for each row of
    points to get n 1D curves using <code>u</code> as the parameter, and then
    for the "column" points on the n curves that share a same <code>u</code>
    value, repeat the algorithm using <code>v</code> as the parameter.  Change
    <code>u</code> to get the sweeping surface of this curve and we get the
    Bezier surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the code, I implemented the single interpolation step in
    <code>BezierPatch::evaluateStep()</code> which is identical to Part 1
    except that it uses the parameter passed in for t, and wrote
    <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D()</code> that repeatedly calls evaluateStep()
    until the final step by looping with exiting condtion
    <code>vector size == 1</code>.  Finally, <code>BezierPatch::evaluate()</code>
    simply calls <code>evaluate1D()</code> on each rows and then the column
    with the right parameter value to get the Bezier surface.  I used
    const references to refer to the row points (<code>const auto &rowPoints</code>)
    to avoid copying over memory unnecessarily.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

  <h4>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
  </h4>
  <p>
    The key idea is that you don't need to compute the area of the face;
    computing the normal vector by doing vector cross product of the two sides
    of a triangle, already gives the normal vector whose magnitude is equal
    to (twice) the area of the triangle. Thus, all I did was to
    do this vector cross product for all neighboring faces, sum them,
    and normalize them using <code>Vector3D::unit()</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One detail is that I added a new method <code>Face::normalWeighted()</code>
    in <code>halfEdgeMesh.cpp</code> to do this cross product.  The reason
    was that I found this code to be almost identical to the existing
    <code>Face::normal()</code>, except that it doesn't do <code>unit()</code>
    at the end.  So I offloaded this code to the <code>Face</code> class, and
    simply called to the method in the face traversing loop in
    <code>Vertex::normal()</code>.
  </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

  <h4>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any
    interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
  </h4>
  <p>
  The idea of my implementation is to keep as many as possible the
  <b>invariants</b> that holds regardless of edge flipping, so that we can
  minimize the number of pointer updates and therefore possible bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
  In <code>flipEdge()</code>, there is a comment saying
  <code>// Code should still work if we comment out everything below this.</code>
  The code above this line sets the <code>halfedge</code> pointer of all
  relevant vertices and faces, so that they point to halfedges that stays the same
  change even after flip.  For example, the halfedge of the B vertex
  <code>vb</code> is set to one of the halfedges in the original edge,
  so that even after the flip, the pointed halfedge is not invalidated.
  After that, we can safely update the members of the new halfedges
  (<code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code>) without worrying about the integrity
  of the original mesh elements.
  </p>

  </table>
</div>
  <p>
    (Please note that the dark triangle is from degradation of normal after
    flipping, not a hole in the mesh.)
  </p>

  <p>
  One source of bug that I encountered was not updating the <code>h->face()</code>
  members of the halfedges. This resulted in holes in the rendered mesh,
  probably because the faces were not reachable in the halfedge traversal.
  It was a simple bug in hindsight but it made me realize it's important
  to proof-read the specification of the problem very carefully.
  </p>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
  <h4>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe
    any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
  </h4>
  <p>
    My strategy here was simply to exhaustively list all the pointer updates,
    regardless of whether they will actually be changed after the split, to
    prevent mistakes.  The lines that have a comment <code>// remove?</code>
    at the end are the ones that can likely be safely removed, because their
    values would not change (but I ended up leaving them in anyways.)
  </p>
  <p>
    In the code, <code>h1</code> ... <code>h8</code> denotes the eight halfedges
    that will be inside the polygon after the split.  Note that <code>h1</code>
    and <code>h2</code> are reused from before the split; this is to avoid any
    deletion of mesh elements, so that looping over them becomes easier with
    no pointer invalidation.  Likewise, <code>f1</code> ... <code>f4</code>
    are the four faces after the split, and <code>eam</code> ... <code>edm</code>
    are the four edges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another rule of thumb was to handle the updates of all the halfedges first,
    which are trickier,
    and only after that think about linking them to the original mesh elements,
    i.e. vertices/edges/faces.

  <p>
    Fortunately this was less of a bumpy ride than part 4, and I think that was
    because I learned how to avoid the kinds of bugs that can come up
    from solving part 4.
  </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>


  <h4>
    Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any
    interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
  </h4>
  <p>
    I directly followed the steps described in the spec/comment. The steps were
    1. compute <code>Vertex::newPosition</code>,
    2. compute <code>Edge::newPosition</code>
    3. split, 4. flip, and 5. update vertex positions.
  </p>
  <p>
    One detail was that to figure out which edge to flip, i.e. to figure out
    which edges are "black" so that they should not be flipped.  The problem
    was that I couldn't use <code>isNew</code> directly, because they are already
    used during the split so that the loop doesn't go over edges that are
    newly created and thus fall into infinite loop.  After this process,
    all edges would be marked <code>isNew</code>, making it unusable to determine
    which are the blue edges in the flipping stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    My solution was to introduce a new class member variable <code>isBlue</code>
    in the <code>Edge</code> class.  I modified the <code>splitEdge()</code>
    method in part 5 so that it marks the newly created edges (<code>eam</code>
    and <code>edm</code>) as <code>isBlue = true</code>, and not the b-c edge
    that was already there before the split.  This way, I could determine
    which are the blue edges that can possibly be flipped easily by simply
    checking that member variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another implementation detail was that for the new vertices that
    are created after splits, instead of waiting to update their position at the
    last stage, I updated them immediately right after calling
    <code>splitEdge()</code> (around line 342).  This seemed like the easiest
    way to associate the <code>Edge::newPosition</code> member variable with
    the actual new vertex that is created on that edge.  In order to do
    this later at the final stage, we'd need some way to query for every new
    vertex which edge that vertex has been created on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code also has a cute trick of finding if a blue edge connects
    a new vertex with an old vertex, by doing XOR on the two <code>isNew</code>
    boolean values of the two vertices (line 358).
  </p>

  <p>
    One thing that can be observed, especially from cube, torus and icosahedron,
    is that the sharp edges become smoother and smoother, which is expected.
    Another perhaps undesirable effect is that those vertices at the edge
    moves towards inside the mesh more and more after subdivision, resulting
    in the overall size of the mesh shrinking and shrinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cause of this is in the way we compute
    the new positions of the vertices. Because the positions of the old vertices
    are computed by doing weighted averages of the neighboring vertices, the more
    a vertex is protruded outwards compared to the neighboring vertices, the further
    it gets "pulled" towards inside at the next subdivision.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is that this effect might not be something wanted for meshes
    that have intentionally sharp points, e.g. ear of a cow, fingers, etc.
    A possible solution to this (as indicated in the question) is to deliberately
    split more edges around the intentionally sharp parts of the mesh.  By
    doing this, the protruding vertices will have more closely neighboring vertices
    that are also protruding outside by similar degrees, and therefore their new position
    will be less different to the old positions after taking the average
    of their positions.
  </p>

  <h4>
    Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube.
    Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions.
    Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube
    subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur.
    Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
  </h4>

  <p>
    This is because the starting edges of the cube were asymmetric to begin
    with.  Because the neighbor relations between the vertices, i.e. edges,
    were asymmetric, their weighted average results were also asymmetric,
    resulting in a skewed smooth surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore the solution is to make the starting edges be in a symmetric
    configuration.  For this, I simply split all the diagonal edges to make
    them look like "X", as shown below.  Now that the connectivity of the edges
    are symmetric when viewed from all 12 sides (or 8 vertices), we arrive at a smooth
    surface that is similarly symmetric.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that even with this the surface does not ever arrive at a perfect
    sphere. This is simply a limitation of the loop subdivision algorithm.
